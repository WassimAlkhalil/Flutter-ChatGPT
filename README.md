I am still in the process of refining my app, with a focus on collecting thorough audit trails and enhancing the user experience. The main objective of the app is to present concise answers to brief questions posed by users. At present, I am actively addressing any potential vulnerabilities in the app and hope to release it to the public in the near future.
